# Arrow Table Games

This project is an assessment performed by Andrew Peet using Unity v2019.4.20f1 and VS Code.

**NOTE** I'm having trouble getting Unity errors to show up in VS Code.
It may be something with the projects configuration, or maybe I haven't
installed the right C# .NET SDK thing?

## Comments

Notes I've left specifically for reviewers of this assessment I've wrapped in `<remarks>`.
Traditionally I don't want code littered with "discussion" comments.
